"""Chess database update using custom deferred update for unqlite.

Run as a new process from the chess GUI.

The customisation is null, and will remain so unless the journals enabling
transaction rollback can be disabled (well then it will not be a customisation
but use of an unqlite feature).  DPT deferred update requires that it's
rollback journals are disabled.
