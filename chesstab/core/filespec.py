    There is not enough data to conclude that Table D usage is proportional
    to the index entries per game, but it is reasonable to expect this and
    the Positions and Table D ratios in the two 528 game samples are close
    enough to make the assumption.  Above, say, 20000 games it is assumed
    that typical games, 75 positions per game and 23 pieces per position,
    lead to a Table B to Table D ratio of 8, or 14 when CQL statements are
    supported.  The higher ratios at lower numbers of games are assumed to
    arise from the lower chance of compressed inverted lists.

    It is completely unclear what value to use for records per Table B page
    because games can have comments and variations as well as just the moves
    played.  The samples have few comments or variations. A value of 10 seems
    as good a compromise as any between wasting space and getting all record
    numbers used. 16 average sized records would fit on a Table B page.
