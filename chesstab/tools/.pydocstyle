# chesstab-4-1-1*py includes code copied from mainstream modules in
# pre-pydocstyle days and there is no point fixing it's pydocstyle
# deficiencies since any future analogue will copy pydocstyle
# compliant code.
# Noticed no invalid-names are reported by pylint for the matched module,
# but the same names in gui.chess are reported.
# In particular, for example, _ChessDB before fixing it.
# It is assumed pylint is taking notice of the match specified here.
